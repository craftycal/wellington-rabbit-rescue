                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                  Rabbits need unlimited access
                  to grass and/or grass hay. They are
                  fibrevores, which means first and
                  foremost, they need fiber.
                  Therefore the most essential part
                  of any rabbit’s diet is grass
                  and hay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Water:</b> Rabbits need access to clean drinking water 24/7. Depending
                  on your rabbit’s preference, this can be in a heavy bowl (they
                  tend to tip over plastic bowls), a licker bottle, or both. You should
                  clean out and change your bunny's water container regularly.
                </p>
                <img src="images/rabbit-models-46(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="a grey and white Netherland dwarf rabbit and his companion, a brown agouti flemmish giant, sit surrounded by bunny food">
                <p>
                  <b>Hay</b> provides long-strand fiber, which is essential for a rabbit’s
                  gut as well as helping to keep their teeth in order. Rabbit’s teeth
                  grow continuously throughout their life and they need to eat fibrous
                  foods in order to keep their teeth worn down. Rabbits that
                  don’t eat enough hay develop painful spurs on their teeth which, if
                  left untreated, will make it painful for them to eat. They may even
                  stop eating which, in a rabbit, is fatal.
                </p>
                <img src="images/rabbit-models-37-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
                <p>
                  Rabbits will naturally graze all day long so they should always have
                  access to fresh, good quality hay. You can purchase hay from local farm
                  stores such as <a href="http://www.ruraltradingpost.co.nz/" target="_blank">Rural Trading Post</a> and <a href="http://www.sharpesfeedbarn.co.nz/" target="_blank">Sharpes.</a>
                  You can also find a variety of hay at pet stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Grass:</b> the fibrous content of grass keeps a Rabbit’s gut mobile.
                  The action of nibbling on grass is also good for their teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Vegetables:</b> Rabbits love green vegetables and a good guide is
                  about a cup of fresh vegetables per day. Leafy greens are best, including
                  kale, broccoli (including broccoli) stalks and leaves, silverbeet and other beet leaves, celery,
                  spinach and herbs such as parsley and coriander. Rabbits also
                  love carrot tops, though the carrot itself should be fed in moderation as it
                  has a high sugar content - too much is not good for your rabbit.
                  Please be aware that any vegetables that are high in water content are not great for your rabbit. Iceberg
                  lettuce in particular should
                  be avoided. If you do feed your
                  bunny lettuce, ensure it’s a small
                  amount and that your rabbit has
                  access to plenty of fibrous food
                  such as hay.
                </p>
                <img src="images/rabbit-models-15(1)-600.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
                <p>
                  <b>Fruit:</b> Rabbits naturally have a very sweet tooth and fruit is a great
                  way to give them a treat. About 1-2 tablespoons of fruit a day is
                  recommended. Rabbits love bananas, apples, grapes, mango and
                  pears. Dried fruits are also great treats, for example raisins, dried
                  pineapple, dried apricots and dates, but be aware that a dried fruit is much smaller than the same
                  fruit before it is dried, so it can be easy to feed too much by accident. Remove the pips
                  from all fruit where possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Rabbit Pellets:</b> The general rule with rabbit food is that the plainer
                  it is the better. Avoid muesli style food and opt
                  for a plain, high fiber pellet.
                  The best rabbit pellet brands available in NZ are <a href="http://www.oxbowanimalhealth.com/products/type/detail?object=1550" target="_blank">Oxbow</a>
                  and <a href="http://www.animates.co.nz/small-pet/small-pet-food-treats/burgess-excel-rabbit-nuggets-2kg.html" target="_blank">Burgess Excel.</a>
                  If you are buying from a farm store then the best brand is
                  <a href="https://store.nzfarmsource.co.nz/catalog/nrm-rabbit-pellets-10kg/213265" target="_blank">NRM.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Forage:</b> Several common garden plants are safe for rabbits to eat
                  and they are generally good at knowing what they can and can’t eat.
                  However, please only feed plants that you know are not poisonous
                  to your rabbit and ensure the plants have not been sprayed with weedkillers
                  or pesticides. As with any new food, add it in gradually to your
                  rabbits diet and keep an eye out for any changes in your rabbit’s
                  poo. If your rabbit has diarrhea contact a rabbit
                  savvy vet immediately - any digestive problem in a rabbit should be considered an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Branches are great for rabbits to
                  chew on and again this is good
                  for their teeth. Try willow, rose, or
                  taupata as well as fruit branches such
                  as apple, pear, or hawthorne. As a general rule, avoid branches from fuits with a single seed (plum, cherry, apricot, peach etc)
                  as these are usually poisonous to rabbits. Flax is good for
                  bunnies to chew on and will help keep them occupied.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Caecotrophs:</b> As part of their normal diet rabbits eat a particular
                  kind of their own droppings called Caecotrophs. They need to do this as
                  they cannot extract all the vital fiber and nutrients they need first
                  time around. The bacteria from their first pass also provides them with protein and B vitamins.
                  Unlike the normal dry droppings you often see, caecotrophs
                  are shiny, sticky and smelly. Rabbits eat these
                  directly from the anus so you shouldn’t see them often. To see
                  them occasionally is normal but regular sightings may mean that your rabbit’s
                  diet is either too rich or they are having problems eating,  possibly
                  due to obesity, large dewlaps, or dental problems. You should
                  contact a rabbit savvy vet if you have any concerns.

                <p>
                  When it comes to housing your rabbit the general rule is the more
                  space the better. Rabbits need lots of exercise!

                  WRR has a minimum space
                  requirement of 1m wide x
                  1m high x 2m long – this
                  should include a warm dry
                  ‘bed’ space of at least 61cm
                  x 61cm

                    They can easily be adapted by permanently attaching runs or pens,
                    and can be made more secure by adding a roof. If you have a
                    secure property then you could roof your pens with something as simple as bird
                    netting or chicken mesh. If you feel predators could be
                    an issue then you should use weldmesh.
                    Areas of your home and garden can also be made rabbit-proof so
                    your bunnies can live free range. Feel free to message us for suggestions
                    and advice!

                    Rabbits are very tidy creatures and can be litter trained. You can
                    use a cat litter tray (I find this works best) or the corner litter trays
                    designed for rabbits. You can use many different things for litter
                    – the best type of litter is recycled newspaper litter. A good idea is
                    to line the tray with newspaper, put down the recycled newspaper
                    litter and then put straw over top.
                    <p>
                      Litter training is SUPER easy!
                      Every time they poop just
                      scoop it up and place it in the
                      litter tray until your bunny gets
                      the idea. If you find they aren’t
                      choosing to pee in their litter
                      tray then if you place a tissue in
                      their pee and then place it under
                      the straw in the litter tray
                      this will help them know where
                      to go.
                    </p>

                      If you are planning on having indoor, litter trained rabbits then
                      you need to “rabbit proof” your house. Rabbits love to chew cords
                      – whether they are plugged in or not! To save your bunny (and your wallet) getting
                      shocked, we recommend having
                      any cords tied up and well out of bunny's reach!

                    <p>
                      Rabbits are highly intelligent and are often misunderstood due to
                      their quiet nature. They need lots of stimulation to prevent them
                      from getting bored. These don’t need to be expensive toys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A great bunny toy is a simple cardboard box - just cut two door holes
                      and they will happily explore and enjoy “renovating” their box to their liking.
                      A cardboard tube/empty toilet roll or egg box
                      stuffed with hay and a few raisins makes a great toy, as do fabric
                      tunnels. They also love digging and jumping so fill a box with soil or
                      try giving them a sandpit.

                    <h3>Socialisation/Rabbit Bonding</h3>
                    <p>
                      Rabbits are very social animals
                      and thrive with the company of
                      their own kind. In the wild they
                      live in large colonies and this
                      social side of their nature is still
                      very evident in the domestic
                      rabbit. At WRR we don’t believe
                      any rabbit should live alone.
                      This is partly for their mental
                      health - they need interaction
                      and a friend for company, but
                      also for their physical wellbeing. Rabbits are very clean animals
                      and will groom each other. This is also a sign of affection between
                      rabbits.

                      very evident in the domestic
                      rabbit. At WRR we don’t believe
                      any rabbit should live alone.
                      This is partly for their mental
                      health - they need interaction
                      and a friend for company, but
                      also for their physical wellbeing. Rabbits are very clean animals
                      and will groom each other. This is also a sign of affection between
                      rabbits.

                      Young rabbits housed together will often begin to fight when they
                      reach sexual maturity, around 3 - 6 months of age. If the fighting leads to biting or any skin
                      injury then they need to be separated until they are desexed.

                      WRR help to ‘bond’ rabbits. Bonding
                      involves introducing rabbits
                      on neutral territory where neither
                      rabbit has been before, for short
                      periods of time depending on how
                      they get along. For more information

                    <h3>The Rabbit Human Relationship</h3>
                    <p>
                      Rabbits are prey animals and, contrary to popular belief, most do
                      not like being picked up. This is because, to a rabbit, being picked up
                      off the ground is similar to being caught by a predator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rabbits do, however, like receiving
                      attention with all four legs
                      on the ground. They love having
                      their heads and ears stroked
                      and many enjoy having their cheeks
                      rubbed.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/DSC_0063.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="">
                    <p>
                      You will often need to earn a rabbit’s trust before handling them. A good way
                      to let your rabbit know that you aren’t a threat is to just
                      spend time with it. Get down to their level and sit or lie down in
                      their pen; allow them to come to you in their own time. This may
                      take a while but it’s worth being patient. Rabbits love treats like
                      dried fruit so try hand feeding them one or two morsels when you
                      sit with them. They will soon start to associate you with treats and
                      before too long will run up to you and allow you to pat them.

                    <h3>Desexing</h3>
                    <p>
                      ALL rabbits should be desexed and vaccinated. Here are a few good
                      reasons why:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        There are too many unwanted rabbits in animal shelters all
                        over the New Zealand. Unfortunately a huge number of healthy
                        rabbits are euthanised each day because there are not enough
                        homes or spaces in shelters for them. Desexing your rabbit
                        means preventing more animals suffering this fate. <br/>(WRR never
                        euthanises rabbits unless they are too sick or injured to survive
                        and it is in their best interest. This decision is never taken lightly.)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Rabbits breed... well, like rabbits. A female
                        rabbit can have up to 10 babies per litter and can get pregnant
                        again as soon as she has given birth. That's up to 80 babies in her first year of life! Not only is that a lot of rabbits,
                        back-to-back pregnancies can take a terrible toll on mum-rabbit.
                        It is very important to desex
                        your female rabbit even if she is not housed with a male as accidents can still happen.
                        For example - we have many cases where unspeyed female
                        rabbits become pregnant to wild male rabbits. Wild rabbits can
                        break into a female rabbit’s cage or if the female is feeling very
                        hormonal she may even break or dig her way out!
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Desexing your rabbit also prevents health problems in the future -
                        female rabbits, for example, are extremely prone to uterine
                        cancer, which is fatal.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Rabbits are very hormonal creatures and being entire (not desexed)
                        can cause them mental stress. They are likely to pace,
                        spray, dig and just be generally destructive. Desexing your
                        rabbit helps relax their temperament. It also helps prevent female
                        rabbits from having ‘false pregnancies’ which are very, very
                        common. A false pregnancy can drive a rabbit to pull out her fur,
                        make a nest and even produce milk which is all very stressful on
                        a her body. This can happen even if you have NO male rabbits
                        around.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Desexed rabbits are also a lot easier to bond. They are less
                        territorial and enjoy the company of other rabbits without the
                        hormonal stress.
                      </li>

                    <h3>Rabbit Health</h3>
                    <p>
                      Rabbits are quite fragile creatures and, as prey animals, they hide
                      pain and injury well. They do this so that predators will not see them as an easy target. Unfortunately,
                      this means that by the time your rabbit shows outward signs of illness it could be very
                      serious. If you see <i>any</i> sign of illness in your rabbit, take them to a rabbit-savvy vet right away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Here are some common problems rabbits in New Zealand face:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Gut Stasis:</b><br>
                      If your rabbit stops eating or appears to be off its food, it is imperative
                      you keep a very close eye on them. If a rabbit stops eating then their
                      gut may go into stasis and this can be fatal within just 24hrs. If you
                      put down their favourite food and they turn their nose up at it, take
                      them straight to a rabbit savvy vet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>RHD/Calicivirus:</b><br>
                      Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), also known as haemorrhagic viral
                      disease (RHVD), is a disease that was illegally introduced
                      into New Zealand in 1997 with the aim of killing wild rabbits. Thirty to eighty percent of animals
                      exposed to the virus will develop the disease. Almost 100% of
                      infected animals will die.<br>
                      It is not entirely known how the virus is transmitted, but at this stage it is thought
                      that rabbits acquire this disease by breathing
                      it in, ingestion, direct contact or through infected urine or faeces. Insects
                      are also able to carry the virus, so keeping your bunny away from other rabbits
                      is not enough to keep this highly infectious disease from affecting your rabbit.
                      The incubation period is 1-3 days and research has shown that rabbits
                      younger than 8 weeks of age are usually resistant to the virus.<br/>
                      There are three forms of the disease which, in severe cases, cause
                      bleeding in the lungs, windpipe, liver, spleen, kidneys, and
                      heart.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the mildest form of the disease, rabbits develop depression and  anorexia followed by recovery.
                      Rabbits who survive the mild form will be immune and cannot be re-infected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A more serious case would involve depression, anorexia, difficulty breathing, shaking, and death
                      within one to two days. You might also notice a foamy or bloody
                      discharge from the nose or anus, nervous signs or rapid death. Sometimes rabbits
                      may appear to recover, then die several days later.
                    </p><p>
                      Sometimes, a rabbit infected with calcivirus will simply die without showing any other symptoms.</p>
                      <p>
                        There is a vaccination available for calcivirus and we recommend that all pet rabbits receive this vaccine at six weeks of age,
                        with boosters every three to four weeks until they are three months old. Adult rabbits should be vaccinated as soon as possible,
                        and will require a booster once a year. If you begin vaccination at or after 3 months old then your rabbit will not need another booster that year.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        <b>Coccidiosis:</b><br>
                        Coccidiosis is caused by a type of parasite called a
                        coccidian protozoa. This parasite is widespread and can be found throughout New Zealand.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Rabbits are most at risk during their first nine months of life. Older rabbits appear to be more resistant to infections,
                        but a rabbit who is weak or immunocompromised by still be in danger.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Most rabbits carry small numbers of coccidia in their digestive system. This is normal, but in
                        some cases these parasite can
                        overwhelm the immune system and build up to high numbers. This
                        can cause illness and, in severe cases, death.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Signs your rabbit may have coccidiosis:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Diarrhoea (or runny poos)</li>
                        <li>Weight loss</li>
                        <li>Lack of appetite</li>
                        <li>Lethargy</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        If your rabbit is showing any of the above signs please take them
                        to a rabbit savvy vet immediately.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Treatment:<br>
                        There are many different products available to treat coccidia. We
                        have found baycox to be the most effective treatment in cases we
                        have seen. Your local vet can prescribe this for you.
                        Due to the life cycle of the parasite, Baycox should be given at a rate
                        of 2.5 to 5mg/kg for two consecutive days, then wait five days and
                        repeat the treatment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Almost all animal species have their own, species-specific form of
                        coccidia parasite. Rabbit coccidia only affects rabbits and is not
                        infectious for humans or other non-rabbit pets.

                        <b>Dental Health:</b> <br>
                        A rabbit’s teeth grow continuously
                        throughout its life
                        and it is vital that they eat high-fibre food to wear these
                        down. A rabbit with overgrown teeth will have difficulty eating and may develop other problems as a result.
                        Sometimes a rabbit’s
                        teeth can also develop
                        spurs which cut into their
                        mouth. This can be very
                        painful and deter them from
                        eating.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A very common dental problem for rabbits is malocclusion. This
                        means their teeth do not meet, and therefore do not wear down the
                        way they should. If your rabbit is exhibiting any of the following
                        signs please get your rabbit to a vet ASAP:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Weepy Eyes</li>
                        <li>Lack of appetite</li>
                        <li>Wet chin/Dribbling</li>
                        <li>Swelling around the face/mouth</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        <b>Flystrike:</b><br>
                        Rabbits with runny poos/diarrhoea or injuries (infected wounds in
                        particular) can be prone to flystrike, particularly in summer. Flystrike
                        occurs when the fly lays its eggs in the poo around the rabbit’s
                        bottom or near/in the any wounds your rabbit might have. The
                        eggs then hatch into maggots which burrow into and eat the skin of
                        the rabbit, causing severe pain and often death from shock. Flystrike
                        rarely if ever affects healthy rabbits. It is VERY important to keep
                        your rabbit clean if it has diarrhoea. You can do this by clipping the
                        rabbit’s fur around their bottom and keeping the area clean.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Please DO NOT bath your rabbit and check with your rabbit savvy
                        vet if you wish to use shampoo to clean your rabbit’s bottom.
                        We only use Whoop Itch and Ouch shampoo on rabbits here at WRR
                        and only when the situation is dire! Rabbits cannot regulate their
                        body temperature well and when bathing a rabbit the water penetrates
                        right through the fur; unlike rain, which runs off their fur and
                        doesn’t go through to the skin. It is important to check
                        your rabbit for flystrike in the summer months. If your rabbit has
                        any signs of flystrike take it straight to a rabbit savvy vet!

                        <b>Heatstroke:</b><br>
                        Rabbits do not cope well in the heat and need a helping hand in the
                        summer months. Always ensure your rabbit has shade and plenty
                        of water. A good idea is to wet towels and hang them as shade
                        cloths - the moisture in the towels helps to cool the air. A good trick
                        is to freeze water bottles and then place them in your rabbit’s hutch
                        or run for them to lie next to on hot days, you can wrap the bottle
                        in a tea towel.

                        A fun way to keep your rabbit cool and give them enrichment at the
                        same time is to freeze pieces of fresh fruit with water in ice cube
                        trays - popsicles for bunnies!. Don't forget to include this in your bunny's fruit allowance for the day.<br/>
                        If you rabbit is indoors, ensure the curtains are pulled to give them
                        shade and consider using a fan to keep the air flowing and cool.

                        <b>Pastuerella/Rabbit Snuffles:</b><br>
                        All rabbits carry a bacteria in their respiratory tract called Pastuerella.
                        Some rabbits are more susceptible to the symptoms of this
                        bacteria and some only develop symptoms in times of stress or ill
                        health.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Pastuerella can cause
                        your rabbit to have cold like symptoms.
                        Some rabbits get over this
                        quite quickly on their own, but
                        sometimes it can develop quickly
                        into a more serious or recurring
                        illness of the respiratory tract. If
                        you notice your rabbit is sneezing,
                        look out for it producing any mucus
                        from the nose or eyes. Rabbits
                        often use their front paws to wipe
                        their faces so if you see mucus on
                        their front feet this is a tell-tale
                        sign.

                        Take your bunny to see a rabbit savvy vet if your rabbit has mucus,
                        appears lethargic or, as with all other rabbit illnesses, if they stop
                        eating or using the toilet.

                        <b>Fleas and Mites:</b><br>
                        Rabbit’s aren’t as prone to getting fleas as a dog or cat, but mites
                        are very common, particularly during the Spring/Summer months.
                        You can treat your rabbit with Revolution Small Animal for both
                        fleas and mites. Please talk to your vet about the dose rate before
                        giving your rabbit Revolution as some smaller breeds of rabbit may not need the full packet.
                        Guinea pig mites can also be treated with this product.
